            It will be soon be proven through indisputable and insurmountable evidence that Sergey Rumyantsev, a current math teacher at Panyadee International school, has been and was both complicit and a willing participant in a multi-million baht drug operation which was run out of Panyadee International  School for over two years. 

Sergey Rumyantsev charged a commission on accepting baht and converting that baht into bitcoin. Then he would send that bitcoin back knowing it was being used on purchasing large amounts of party drugs off of the dark web and that those same drugs were being imported onto Koh Samui through the mail room of Panyadee International School. 

There are innumerous texts, pictures, attachments, screenshots, and of course the public block chain ledger which list every bitcoin transaction ever made between the two parties which will all be provided as proof.

Money was given, Sergey deposited the money to his SCB account and then transferred the funds, minus his commission, to his bitkub account where he used them to purchase bitcoin. Then he would transfer the bitcoin to the specified wallet to be used for drug purchases, known of by him by his own words. After a week or sometimes two, an increasingly larger portion of profits would be given to Sergey in cash, for the process to be repeated so that eventually there was millions of baht worth of MDMA, XTC, marijuana, LSD and Ketamine shipped to the school each month which was picked up from the mailroom and distributed by others around Koh Samui. Many of you there had a wonderful time, many times, thanks to this operation - though since its discovery almost to a T all of you same people have gone the way of the Ostrich or else the crab. 

To those among you know that your opinions on this are as worthless as your help has been - excepting those few amongst you which did risk yourself for a friend and good person. All will be remembered and repaid in kind. There are only two people on Samui for which I am beholden to at this point, not a single one more. 

Indisputable and verifiable proof will be provided in the near future to prove that which has been stated here without any shadow of a doubt. Proof that will show him not only to be due for immediate termination from Panyadee, but for immediate arrest and imprisonment as well.
